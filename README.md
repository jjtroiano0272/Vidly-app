## Additions (+)

[ ] Add a 'default message' to display for Select components when nothing is selected. A sort of 'dropdown prompt'/
[ ] Hook up the app to an external API taking real-world data.
[ ] The 'New Movie' button/form doesn't actually submit to the DB yet, just console logs the action. Make it so it sends an HTTP PUT to my DB.
[ ] Set focus on the search box when first loaded. On registration page, allow keyboard nav and autofocus on the next element after pressing return. Same thing for submitting a new movie.
[ ] Render the Genre Select element as an accordion dropdown list.
[ ] Fancy-formatting for Select elements.

[ ] SVG backgrounds do not work in safari it seems. Find a way to fix this. This page looks correct in firefox or Chrome but has no BG in Safari.
